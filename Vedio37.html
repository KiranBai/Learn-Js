// Javascript , It is synchronous language once one code executed then other it is not a parallel working style.
// It is single Thread Every code run on single same Thread
// These above behaviour of Javascript is default
// If we moving from default version then we use Execution Context like Memory Heap Stack , each operation wait for last one to complete before executing
// Execution Context is a stack of memory heap where each operation is stored and executed one by one

// Blocking code vs Non Blocking code
// Blocking code is a code which is waiting for previous code to complete before executing like Read Files Synchronous
// Non Blocking code is a code which is executing in parallel with other code like Read File ASynchronous
// Javascript Engine is made by Memory Heap and Call Stack
// WEb API we can found on browser then they can access functionality of DOM API , Asynchoronous API fetch(),Set timeout , Set Interval
// Task Queue add Call back in a Stack Queue one by one
